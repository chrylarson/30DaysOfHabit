Thirty days is a short, long time. Huge goals can be accomplished in 30 days. Tough commitments can be held for 30 days. It is the perfect length of time to stretch myself and achieve my goals.

I used to believe that limitations would restrict my talents. Now I know that limitations let my creativity shine. A limit of 30 days give boundaries to my dreams. The 30 day framework helps me focus on small tasks that I can complete.

In one year I will complete 12 challenges. That’s a lot of progress. I don’t think I have ever completed 12 big goals in a year before. I have not planned and tracked that many goals before.

In ten years I will complete 120 goals. Wow! That is a lot of progress and all I need to do is take it 30 days at a time. 

Steady, consistent commitments, 30 days at a time.
