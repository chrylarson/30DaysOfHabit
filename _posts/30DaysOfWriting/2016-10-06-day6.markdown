Each day I make a decision to be a runner. I decide I will put on my shoes and run today. 

If I’m feeling tired, I choose to run. 

If I’m feeling sore, I choose to run.

If I’m feeling stressed, I choose to run.

If I’m feeling hungry, I choose to run.

If the weather is hot, I choose to run.

If the weather is cold, I choose to run.

If I’m feeling too busy, I choose to run.

No matter how I’m feeling, I choose to run.

After a year, I have chosen more often than not to be a runner and that makes me a runner.
