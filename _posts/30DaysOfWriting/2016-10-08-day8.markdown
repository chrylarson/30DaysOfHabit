Running is personal. There isn’t a one size fits all training plan. Genetics, lifestyle, local weather, weekly calendar and numerous other factors determine when and how I can train.

I have a genetic limit. If I train perfectly then I will reach my genetic limit. At this point I don’t know if my genetics are a better sprinter, 5k runner or marathon runner. I just have to start running and see what distances I prefer.

My lifestyle, where I live and my weekly schedule play a huge role in determining when I can run and for how long. At this time I’m limited to my lunch hour. Long training runs are not an option. I have to finish my run and shower in one hour. 

I’ve had to adopt portions of popular training plans and fit them to my life. My running plan is working. I’m becoming a stronger runner. Running is a personal journey only I can map and travel. I take guidance when it is available, but in the end I need to adapt.
