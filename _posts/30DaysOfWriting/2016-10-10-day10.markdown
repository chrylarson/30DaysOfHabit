A runner is committed to the journey, not a goal. Running is a lifestyle not a destination. 

Running has seasons. A season of training, a season of maintaining and a season of exploring. A runnerâ€™s style will flow and change. In one season a runner will prepare for a quicker 5K, in another season a marathon or in another season explore obstacle course running. 

Running is about living a fuller and healthier life. Small goals along the journey keep things interesting, but they are not the end. Running makes life better, happier. A day with running is a better day.

Getting outdoors and running brings joy to a runner.
