Running is the best way to calm my overactive mind. Running brings focus when my thoughts are scattered. It brings calm when my thoughts are angry or worried. 

The beauty of a wooded trail and the rhythm of my steps help my mind to relax. The combination of measured a beat and diverse scenery are perfect for inspiring me.

When I’m distracted at work or have a tough challenge to tackle I go for a run. I let my mind work on the problem while my body focuses on the movement. Sometimes I’m have breakthrough moments. Other times I realize I just need to buckle down and do the work.
