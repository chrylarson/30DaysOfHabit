Running is simple. 

I should have started a running habit 10 years ago, or 8 years ago or even 3 years ago.

Each time I talked myself out of starting by focusing on the overwhelming details. I obsessed over not having good shoes, the right shorts, a proper running path nearby, enough time, it was too cold/hot, or it just wasn’t a good day to start.

Running is simple. 

Put on shoes. 

Run.

I couldn’t pick the right training plan. Which plan is the best? 

It doesn’t matter. 

Just go running. 

Do I rest every other day? Go for long runs on the weekends? Should I stretch? What about interval training??? 

It doesn’t matter. 

Just go run.

I used the details as an excuse. Go running and you’ll be a runner. The rest are inconsequential details. Before the details matter I need to have a solid base. Before the details matter I need to be able to run a 5K without feeling like I’m dying. Ignore the details and run.

Put on shoes.

Run.
