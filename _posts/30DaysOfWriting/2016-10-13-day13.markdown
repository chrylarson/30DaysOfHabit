A good run is only good if it is followed by another good run tomorrow.

Running is the goal. Fitness and health are excellent byproducts of running. Running by itself is what I seek. Running helps me achieve stillness in my mind.

As my health and fitness improve, so does my running. I can run smoother. I can run longer. I can run with more intensity. When my mind is busy churning thoughts, I can run in pace with my thoughts.

I feel best running intervals on an intense thought. A complex and nuanced thought sustains me through long runs. My thoughts lead my running and my running resolves my thoughts.

A good run brings peace to my day. Tomorrow I will face new challenges and I will run again.
