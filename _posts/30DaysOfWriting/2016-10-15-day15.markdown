Running to find the calm.

I find a calm void in running. Today I was exhausted and overwhelmed. My sleep was fitful and interrupted. My allergies were flaring. My toddler was asking so many questions. I wanted a break, an escape, just for a few minutes.

In the past I would have sought a nap, or comfy chair to doze off in. Today, my first thought was to go for a run. Put my toddler in the stroller and go running together. Running, even when Iâ€™m tired and weak, gives me mental strength.
