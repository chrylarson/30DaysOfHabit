Running Rhythm

I love hearing the steady beat of my foot falls. I find comfort in the rhythm. I celebrate each step. Each step brings me closer to my day’s goal. 

When I run 5 kilometers I make around 4,400 steps. If I look at a single step it would seem meaningless. Once I make four thousand steps in a row I have a 5K. 

The old saying is “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” I admit I used to brush this off as obvious. Now that I run I am beginning to understand the significance. 

The journey begins with a single step and ends with a commitment to make four thousand more steps just like the first one.
