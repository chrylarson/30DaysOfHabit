I started running and dieting so that I’d have the strength and stamina to challenge my sons in athletics. I want to be the fittest 40 year old. I am amazed at how quickly I’ve come to enjoy the daily exercises.

The health boost of running is amazing. I can spend an entire day carrying a 40 pound toddler around the zoo, then around the Mall of America and still have energy to play in the backyard when we get home.

I look forward to my interval training and my long runs. I know the stress strengthens my body and toughens my mind. I’m glad I started my running habit. I’m more excited about where my running feet will take me.
