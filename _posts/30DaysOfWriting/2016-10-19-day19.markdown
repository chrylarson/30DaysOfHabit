I saw two runners today. One was running with powerful steps while sweat dripped off his whole body. He coughed and spat. He had determination. He wanted to be the best.

His whole body was tense. As he came barreling down the path I could taste his tension. He was like an I-beam under too heavy a load. At any moment he might come crashing down.

A few moments later another runner was gliding towards me. His motion was fluid and smooth. His movements were strong and beautiful. His whole being was running. He wore a smile, even as the sweat wicked off him. 

As he approached I could feel the lightness of his steps. He was in is element. Running was him and he was running. There was no doubt that he loved the sport of running.
