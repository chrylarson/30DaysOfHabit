Yesterday I planned to stay at my desk. I planned to not go running. 

I went running.

I think it must be habit. In the middle of my day my mind switches and decides it is time to run. The runs are good for me. Running clears my head. Running gives me new inspiration.

I found that running in the middle of a tough problem brings me peace and sometimes a solution. My mind works best when I’m content and relaxed. Running moves me to be content and relaxed.

When I’m relaxed my creative muscles works, my problem solving works. After a good run my mind functions well. After a good run I focus; I solve.
