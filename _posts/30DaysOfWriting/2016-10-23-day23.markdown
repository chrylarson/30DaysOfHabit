Running with beginners

It is easy to forget where I came from. It is easy to forget my struggles. It is easy to assume Iâ€™ve always been able to do this.

This weekend I worked with beginners. There were several times where I might have interjected with the correct answer. I kept quiet. Too often an experienced person discourages a beginner by informing how little they know.

I kept quiet and let the beginners explore and learn. Yes, we made mistakes together. Yes, we learned more than we had in awhile. This weekend was a huge success. Everyone was stronger for it. Failure is good. 

Everytime I run, I fail. I fail to meet my goal. I fail to run as fast as I want. I fail to run as far as I want. Sometimes I even fail to run at all. Failure is good when it is failing forward.

Each failure teaches me and strengthens me. Running is teaching me to be comfortable enduring failure. I do not like failure. I do not like running in the cold. I learn to endure these things to become a stronger human.
