Throwing out goals

It has been 168 days since I started running. It has taken me 167 days to discover what elite running coaches have been saying all along. 

When I started running I set an arbitrary goal of a fast marathon time. How did I come up with the goal? I read a couple articles that suggested it would be a fast marathon time. 

Insane. 

I’ve never run a marathon. Why did I think that I could set a time goal?

Setting a marathon time goal is ridiculous for two reasons. First, I should see if I can run just 5 kilometers. Second, maybe I’m gifted and can run faster than the goal. I wouldn’t be running my best. Oh, and third pushing myself to meet an arbitrary goal is a quick path to injury.

Eventually I came to my senses and I dealt with my ego. I developed my running base. Now I run for myself. I run to be my personal fastest. I run to be in my best health. 

I run to be the best me I can be.
