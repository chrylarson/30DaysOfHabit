I didn’t sleep last night. One child had a fever and the other had insomnia. Between the two kids waking up my FitBit gave up on recording my sleep.

Before I started running I’d have been wrecked today. 

I’m great! 

Running has taught me my limits. I’m not tired because I know what tired is. Tired is the last mile of a long run after I forgot breakfast and didn’t sleep.

Today is a great day!
