Snow was falling in big fat flakes. This was winter. There was a cold wind and a thick blanket of snow. It was the perfect day to stay inside reading a good book. Instead, I was out walking with cold, numb toes.

I had made a decision to walk every day. At lunch time I’d dress for the weather and go outside. I set a timer for 15 minutes. I’d walk for 15 minutes then turn around and walk back for a 30 minute walk.

No matter the weather, my work load or my hunger I’d go walking. This small commitment to walking every day turned me into a runner. After months of walking I decided it was time to go to the next level.

I would start running.

I’d set a timer for 10 minutes and run. After 10 minutes I’d turn around and run back. A 10 minute shower and clean-up kept me within my 30 minute goal. 

I’m a runner because I decided to walk.
