I’m still running a month after completing my 30 Days of Running challenge. I don’t run every day like I did during the challenge. I run most days. The days I don’t run I feel the urge to run. 

On my off days I move. I do push-ups and sit-ups. I walk extra flights of stairs. I move. My health continues to improve.

I started my 30 Days of Running Challenge to become a healthier 40 year old (I’m in my 30’s). I want to be the fittest dad at my kids’ school. I want to challenge my boys in sports. I want to be the example of a healthy lifestyle. Kids do what you do and not what you say. 

I am doing healthy and it feels great.
