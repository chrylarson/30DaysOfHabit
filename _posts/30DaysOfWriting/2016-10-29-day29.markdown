Planning for failure


I had many excuses when I started running. Most of them were trivial and avoidable. If I wanted a reason to not run I always had one. I overcame myself with failure plans. 


If I forgot my running shoes, I still had to run. If I forgot my towel, I still had to run. If I had a lunch meeting, I still had to run. Anything that could happen needed a backup plan. 


It took me a few minutes to list the possible failures. Then it took me another ten minutes to pack my car with backups and plan alternative running times if the lunch hour was booked. 


A few days during my 30 Days of Running Challenge I used a backup plan. If I hadn't planned to fail I would have failed all together. I made failure part of the plan and plotted paths from failure back to success.
